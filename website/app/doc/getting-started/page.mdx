# Getting Started

Textrix is a lightweight, powerful, and flexible rich-text editor built for modern web apps.  
It's easy to set up, easy to theme, and easy to extend with your own features.

---

## Textrix Editor

Textrix works in all modern browsers. Drop it into your frontend, pick the built-in features you need, and apply your preferred theme. _(Only one
theme available for now, but more are coming soon!)_

Textrix comes with powerful, customizable **plugins** you can import and add to your editor, like: [Bubble Menu](/doc/bubble-menu) ðŸ«§,
[Floating Menu](/doc/floating-menu) ðŸŽˆ, [Emoji Picker](/doc/emoji) ðŸ˜Š, [Code Block](/doc/code-block) \</> , and many more.

It supports multiple output formats:

- **JSON** &ndash; To track user changes and document state
- **HTML** &ndash; Generate static HTML from the JSON doc, to render articles, blogs and stories
- **Plain Text** &ndash; Just the raw content

## Textrix on the Backend

Textrix plays well with Node.js too!

Use it to:

- Validate and manage rich-text documents
- Extract metadata (like **title**, **subtitle**, or **featured image**)
- Generate the HTML for publishing

All this thing also works well on the Editor, but you can use it on the backend to add a layer of security.

Great for headless CMSs, static site generators, and custom pipelines.

## Design

Textrix is modular and flexible. It works both in the browser and on the backend with _Node.js_. You can use as much or as little of the features on
your editor as you want, and your bundle size will adapt.

Textrix is also **Framework-Agnostic**, use it on **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, or **Plain Javascript**

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install Textrix, you can use a package manager like npm or a CDN

### Using NPM

```bash
npm install textrix
```

### Using CDN

Load Textrix directly from the CDN, available in both ESM and UMD formats.

#### ESM

```js
import { Editor } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/textrix@0.1.9/dist/es/index.js';
import { BubbleMenu, FloatingMenu, Media } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/textrix@0.1.9/dist/es/features.js';
```

#### UMD

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/textrix@0.1.9/dist/umd/editor.min.js"></script>

<!-- Common features in one script: BubbleMenu, FloatingMenu, CodeBlock, Media, Emoji -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/textrix@0.1.9/dist/umd/features/common.min.js"></script>

<!-- and it's easy to individually load additional features -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/textrix@0.1.9/dist/umd/features/emoji.min.js"></script>
```

Common features will be available in `CommonFeature{:js}` var, use it like `CommonFeature.Emoji{:js}`

## ðŸŽ¨ Themes
