# Features

üëà Explore the features using the menu on the left.

Textrix comes with a rich set of built-in **features** (a.k.a plugins), but we call them _features_ because they more internal thing then external.

Everything you need to build a complete, modern editor is included in the main `textrix` package. You can also create your own plugins, and only
bundle the features you actually use. üòä

## ‚úçÔ∏è What You Get

The editor supports both **content elements** and **inline formatting** like:

- Paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, and lists
- Inline styles like **bold**, _italic_, `inline code`, and [@mentions](#)

By default, the editor includes [basic features](#built-in-features) like paragraphs and bold formatting and they are called formats. However, you can
easily exclude any features you don't need using the `formats` option in the editor settings. Just set the feature to `false` to remove it.

Additionally, Textrix offers [interactive features](#additional-features) like:

- [Media](/doc/meida) Embed images, auto-upload to your CDN, or drop in videos (YouTube, Vimeo, Tweets, etc.)
- üòä [Emoji Picker](/doc/emoji) Type `:` to open a searchable emoji menu
- [Code Block](/doc/code-block) Add and format code snippets, with highlight

‚Ä¶and more to explore!

<Notice>
Be careful not to exclude core features, as it might affect the editor‚Äôs functionality.
</Notice>

## Adding a New Feature

Import any features you need from `textrix/features`, then list them in the `features` array when creating your editor:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
import { Editor } from 'textrix';
import { Media, BubbleMenu, FloatingMenu, Emoji, CodeBlock } from 'textrix/features';

const editor = new Editor({
  element: document.body,
  features: [
    Media,
    BubbleMenu,
    FloatingMenu,
    Emoji,
    CodeBlock
  ]
});
```

## Configuring Features

All features support options via a `.configure(){:js}` method, For example, here's how to upload inserted images to your CDN using the [Media](/doc/media)
feature:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Function to upload editor image to my CDN
const uploadImage = async ({ file }) => {
  const imageUrl = uploadToMyCDN(file);

  // Return the URL of the uploaded image from the CDN
  return { url: imageUrl };
};

const editor = new Editor({
  features: [
    Media.configure({ uploadImage })
  ],
});
```

You can add options to any feature using `.configure(){:js}`, or simply use the default settings if you don‚Äôt need customizations.

## Built-in Features

Here‚Äôs a list of all the built-in features that come with Textrix. You can easily exclude any of them by adjusting the `formats` option in the editor
